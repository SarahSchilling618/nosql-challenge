Module 12 Challenge

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files, both of which use a json file of establishments located in New York City that is imported into MongoDB to be used for analysis. The first Notebook is used for setup, in adition to making sure the database works an additional resturaunt's data is added to the database and cleaned for analysis. The second Notebook takes futher analysis and answers a few choice questions that are asked, and uses various forms of query searching to find. I attemped to add the establishments json file that was used for this assignment, but Github told me the file was too big to add to the repository. I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment.
